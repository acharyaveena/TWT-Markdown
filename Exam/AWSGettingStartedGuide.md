## About AWS Cloud
AWS (Amazon Web Services) is a set of on-demand, pay-as-you-go cloud services such as:
* Virtual servers (EC2)  
* File storage (S3)  
* Managed databases (RDS)  
* Other managed services

You run applications and store data without owning hardware, scale on demand, and pay only for what you use. Key benefits: scalability, global regions, and built-in security tools.
